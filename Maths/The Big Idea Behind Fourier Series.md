Let's consider the 2 different periodic functions we have above.

**Can we approximate these each 2 ?**
Well we can do but its like very much loosely like in the below image ðŸ˜•

	 we can see the high value of square wave is around the high value of sin wave and also vise versa for the low values. So we can have a little bit of rough sense of approximation.But this is a pretty bad one!

**Let's zoom into a small part of our wave**

How can we make this approximation much more better ?
