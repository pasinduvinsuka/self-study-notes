Let's consider the 2 different periodic functions we have above.

**Can we approximate these each 2 ?**
Well we can do but its like very much loosely like in the below image üòï

	 we can see the high value of square wave is around the high value of sin wave and also vise versa for the low values. So we can have a little bit of rough sense of approximation.But this is a pretty bad one!

**Let's zoom into a small part of our wave**

How can we make this approximation much more better ?

`
we can see that if there is a way we can move this sin wave into the directions marked in the image, then we can have a sort of better approximation than the current one. 

`

**So how can we do that ?**

```
Let's try by introducing a newer sin wave to here instead of only having one the we had before. Now we have 2 sin waves.
```

So once we add the above 2 sin waves together, as a result of that we get the below sin wave.

`Now we can see that this is bit better than the previous approximation we had before üòÅ`

**Let's add another sin wave to this and see what's gonna happen ü§î**

`Wow we get much more better approximation now !`

# AND THIS IS THE BIG IDEA BEHIND THE FOURIER SERIES.

let's keep adding more sin waves into this.
