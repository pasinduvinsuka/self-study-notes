This is an example for a periodic function which goes ups and downs and again ups and downs and so on.

In here what we mean by this function is being periodic (specially being 2Pi periodic) is,
	If we specially take any point in this graph and move over 2Pi it gives us the exact same height.

Which means if we consider a period T and then add it into the current function then we will get back the same exact value as where we started again.
