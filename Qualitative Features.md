We can see here in the point of discontinuity of the square wave, the sum of sin is actually going through that at the value of Pi.

Approximation is pretty good around the values like 3pi/2 and pi/2. But in here we can is at the discontinuity of square wave, the sin wave has kinda jumped up a little bit.
