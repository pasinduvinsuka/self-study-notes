We can see here in the point of discontinuity of the square wave, the sum of sin is actually going through that at the value of Pi.

Approximation is pretty good around the values like 3pi/2 and pi/2. But in here we can is at the discontinuity of square wave, the sin wave has kind of jumped up a little bit. So  this sort of over-shooting right around the discontinuity is called as "Gibbs Phenomenon".
That's a common problem in the Fourier series.

In here we have always used a sin wave to ap
