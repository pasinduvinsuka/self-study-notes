- Let's consider the system that's being controlled as the 'process'.  
- We have access to our inputs. Based on the control scheme we choose we can change those inputs, So these changed variables we will call as 'manipulated variables'. Those variables will be manipulated by an 'Actuator'.

	 Actuators will be driven by the actuating signals which comes the controller. The controller is designed to convert the command variable which comes from a high level control system or froma  a person operate this. Then the controller will convert this commanded variable into a actuating signal.

	Now as operators, what we have to do is we have to choose the set of predefined commands that will generate the proper actuating signal which will affect the manipulated varaible and that manipulated variable will affect the process in a way that we desire.

In this type of controllers, inputs into the system are not fed back from the outputs. So those are called as 'Open loop' controllers.
