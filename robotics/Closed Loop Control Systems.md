Under the [[Closed Loop Control Systems]] I have found that there will be some disturbance for the controlled variable from the nature and things not under our control. So as a solution for this we will be using the closed loop systems.

The controlled variable will go through a sensor and the the sensed variable will be compared with the previously provided commanded variable. By comparing like this we will get the error term which tell us how far we are away from the process we want. 
So based on this, we can use our controller to build a suitable actuating signal which will help us to get the desired manipulated variable which will help to get the expected controlled variable.
