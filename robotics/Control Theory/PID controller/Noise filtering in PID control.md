Noise is a random disturbance on our signal. Those noises are something unavoidable when we are working with sensors.

Temperature captured without and with noises are shown here. Because of the noises we can see there are sort of tiny fluctuations.

Low amplitude signals won't affect for some controllers. **But that's not true for an ideal PID controller.**

In here the derivative part will amplify the high frequency signals, so those tiny barely noticabl
