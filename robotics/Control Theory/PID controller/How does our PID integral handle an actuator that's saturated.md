Let's consider only the integral part from the above example . And also let's imagine we are holding the drone tight using our hands without letting it go at the biggening using our hands.

`So in here initially the error will be 50. So our integral will have that value.So because of that our propllers will start to speed up more. But still we are holding the drone, so the error will remain the same and because of this our controller will increase the propellers speed more and more. But there is a limit of the maximum speed the propeller can have. So once that's reached our propeller won't speeed up more than t`
