I always wanted to do something interesting and amazing than the majority. I was wondering how amazing things I can do by getting into a thing. While I am in a search of this, I found that robotics is a multi disciplinary area where my mind is falling in love with. So I decided to focus well on robotics since its a mix of things I love.

Things I falling love with are 
- Complex and amazing stuffs
- Math
- Low level programming
- Mix of physics
- Mix of electrical engineering
- Basically doing magical stuffs and getting the intuition behind : )
