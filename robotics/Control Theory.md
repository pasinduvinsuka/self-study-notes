Let's consider a car as an example. Car as a whole is a complex system. And the breaking system in the car is a sub part of that. We can consider the breaking system also as a set of collection of small sub parts.

This is the part that is actually converting the car’s kinetic energy into heat energy and reducing the vehicle’s speed. Yet the disc brakes are small systems on their own because they are made up of rotors, calipers, brackets, shielding, fasteners, and hoses which allow the disc brakes to function correctly

Typically we will define the system in the box via mathematical model that will represent the its equations of behavior.

- System can be simple as a single disc disk brake which takes the force of the hydraulic fluid and the output being the temperature of the rotor which slows down the car by converting it's kinematic energy into the heat.
- Or else a system can be complex like a entire car which have hundreds of inputs and outputs.
