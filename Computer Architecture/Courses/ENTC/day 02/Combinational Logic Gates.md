by using the transistors we can make the logic gates. By using those logic gates we can create combinational logic blocks. From this logic blocks we can go the sequential logic blocks. Then state machines, and then sub-systems and then systems. And also we can create giant systems by combining those systems.

*in generally combinational circuit doesn't have a memory. whenever we change the input the output will get changed. but in a sequential circuit, it has  a memory of the previous inputs we have given to the system. so it will take those input considerations in additions to the current inputs we give in order to produce an output.

## Adders

Adder is the basic foundation to all the arithmetic.
