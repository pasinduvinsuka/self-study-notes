There is a method called 'run( )' in the thread class and also importantly this method also  came to the thread class from the runnable interface.

So in here we have created our own thread called 'MyThread' and we will write our job inside the run method. So it will be a child thread here.

So once when we need to run this, we have to instantiate an object from MyThread under the main class.

So once we call the start( ) method on the object we have created, we will get 2 separate threads. Previously we only had the main thread. But now we 2 threads which are ,
	1. 'Main' Thread
	2. 't' Thread

So these 2 threads will be run in a parallel way.

In here if run the main class few times we will notice that the order of execution is random in each run.

The order of execution will completely decided by our Scheduler. The algorithm used by the scheduler will decided the order of our execution. (Round Robbing, FCSC ...)
