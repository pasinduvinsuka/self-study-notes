execution of multiple tasks simultaneously can be called as multi-tasking.
- student takes notes while listening to the lecture

In operating system level, we can divide multi-tasking into 2 categories.

1. Process based multitasking (each task is an independence process) 
		- while writing a java program listening to a song and some files are downloading in the background

1. Thread based multitasking

		lets take there is a code with 3 blocks (u1, u2, u3) and if each will execute one after another we will call it as a single threaded program. ( No multi tasking) . 
		**But if those 3 blocks can run in a parallel way then we call it a multi-threaded program.**

There is 2 ways to define a thread in the java.
	1. Extending Thread Class
	2. Implementing the Runnable Interface
