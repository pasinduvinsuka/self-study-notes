Let's imagine a toy box in the real life. So this toy box only can holds the 10 toys. There are 2 friends. One friend will add toys to the box (Producer). And another friend is taking toys from the box (Consumer). The Producer can't add more toys to the box if the box has reached its limit 10 already. And also the consumer can't take out the toys if the box is empty.

The same sort of scenario has been implemented in the programming with blocking queues.
