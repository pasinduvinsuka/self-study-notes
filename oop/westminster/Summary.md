- Object keeps references. (pointers)

- All instance variables and methods we create are **dynamic** (things created at the runtime) by default unless we use the keyword "static".

### **Static  vs non static

- static means pertaining to the class in general and not only to an object.
- we can access static variables without creating an instance of the class since they are available at the class loading time.
- if a method or a variable is not static, then we need to create an instance first in order to access them.
